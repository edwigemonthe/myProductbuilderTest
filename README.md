# myProductbuilderTest
This is my technical test.
My Impressions

I wasn't expecting a JavaScript oriented test.
This is my first time to hear about a DOM and Jest :).
It proves how much working with you will allow me to learn new things. 
At task 1 level, it was a bit complex at the comprehension level. I managed and I hope my proposed solutions will meet your expectations.

Nevertheless, this test allowed me to learn new things in this world of developers.
